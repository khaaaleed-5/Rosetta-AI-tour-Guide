Rosetta is an AI-powered mobile application designed to bridge the gap between curiosity and knowledge for Egyptian cultural heritage. It addresses the need for accessible cultural education by replacing the limitations of traditional tour guides (cost, time, hassle) with an intelligent, interactive digital assistant. Simply take a picture of a monument or ask a question, and let Rosetta guide you through history.
